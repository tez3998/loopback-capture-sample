# Environments
This worked on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 18.04.
I think this will work on macOS.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Go to the the directory you have just cloned
3. On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager like apt in order to use SoundFile library
4. Run the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
1. Before running the program, start outputting sound from the device`s speaker or headphones so that the program can record that sound.
2. Run the program as below.
```bash
python capture.py
```

3. After seconds, the program produces an audio file named out.wav.
4. Check if the program could record system sounds by playing out.wav.

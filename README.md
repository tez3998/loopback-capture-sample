# loopback_capture_sample
Sample code which records system sounds (what you hear) in Python.

# Environment
This worked on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04.
I think this will work on MacOS.

# Installation
## SoundCard
```bash
pip install SoundCard
```

## SoundFile
```bash
pip install SoundFile
```
On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager like apt.

# Usage
```bash
python capture.py
```

# Environments
This worked on Windows 10/11 and Ubuntu 18.04.
I think this will work on macOS.

# Installation
On Linux, you need to install libsndfile using your distributionâ€™s package manager like apt in order to use SoundFile library.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
```bash
python capture.py
```
